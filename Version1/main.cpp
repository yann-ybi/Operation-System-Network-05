 /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |	A graphic front end for a grid+state simulation.						|
 |																			|
 |	This application simply creates a glut window with a pane to display	|
 |	a colored grid and the other to display some state information.			|
 |	Sets up callback functions to handle menu, mouse and keyboard events.	|
 |	Normally, you shouldn't have to touch anything in this code, unless		|
 |	you want to change some of the things displayed, add menus, etc.		|
 |	Only mess with this after everything else works and making a backup		|
 |	copy of your project.  OpenGL & glut are tricky and it's really easy	|
 |	to break everything with a single line of code.							|
 |																			|
 |	Current keyboard controls:												|
 |																			|
 |		- 'ESC' --> exit the application									|
 |		- space bar --> resets the grid										|
 |																			|
 |		- 'c' --> toggle color mode on/off									|
 |		- 'b' --> toggles color mode off/on									|
 |		- 'l' --> toggles on/off grid line rendering						|
 |																			|
 |		- '+' --> increase simulation speed									|
 |		- '-' --> reduce simulation speed									|
 |																			|
 |		- '1' --> apply Rule 1 (Conway's classical Game of Life: B3/S23)	|
 |		- '2' --> apply Rule 2 (Coral: B3/S45678)							|
 |		- '3' --> apply Rule 3 (Amoeba: B357/S1358)							|
 |		- '4' --> apply Rule 4 (Maze: B3/S12345)							|
